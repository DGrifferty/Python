# 058
# Make a maths quiz that asks five questions by randomly generating
# two whole numbers to make the question (e.g. [num1] + [num2]).
# Ask the user to enter the answer. If they get it right add a
# point to their score. At the end of the quiz, tell them how
# many they got correct out of five.
